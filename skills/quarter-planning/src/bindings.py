"""Where this workspace keeps the registers a quarter is planned from.

Nothing about a quarter's arithmetic is specific to a workspace, but every input to it
is: where the planning basis lives, how a quarter's folder is named, which file carries
the calendar, where the roadmap model and the deliverable register sit. Those are read
from `[suite.quarter-planning]` of the workspace's `.agents/skill-bindings.toml`, the
same file that binds every other skill in the suite.

Paths resolve against that file's directory, never the working directory, so a binding
means the same thing wherever the command is run from. A path may carry `{quarter}`,
which is replaced by the quarter slug, so one binding covers every quarter.

No path has a default. A skill that shipped one workspace's layout as its fallback would
be carrying that workspace around in it, and a workspace that had not bound yet would
read nothing instead of being told what it has not declared. An unbound run names the
keys and stops.

The assumptions themselves, working days, focus factor, expected absence, points per
person-day, are NOT configuration. They are data, they change per quarter, and they
carry their own justification, so they live in the planning basis register the binding
points at.
