"""Validate a quarter's sizing model top down, from the period to the products.

The chain runs one way only. Time and cost are fixed first and scope varies against them,
which is the PRINCE2 Agile position the planning playbook takes. So the quarter's capacity is
established from the calendar and the people before any epic is looked at, and an epic's
budget is a distribution of that capacity rather than a figure derived from its contents.

  1  Period          calendar working days, less generic non-working time
  2  Resources       allocation, less individual non-working time, gives capacity per person
  3  Quarter budget  capacity distributed to epics, with the remainder held unallocated
  4  Epic budgets    each epic's budget_points must follow from the distribution
  5  Elaboration     each epic's named products, against the budget it was given
  6  Load            each person's owned products, against the capacity they brought
  7  Approval        how far the plan, each epic and each product have been approved
  8  Framing         each committed epic's lane and flows, on the definition ladder
  9  Close           what each flow reached and what each product cost, once recorded

Levels 1 to 4 are integrity: a disagreement there means the model contradicts itself and the
run fails. Levels 5 and 6 are subscription: being over is a scoping decision, not a defect,
so it is reported and the run still passes. That distinction is the whole point of separating
budget from planned.

Level 7 reads the `approval` field on the WorkPlan, each committed epic and each of its
products. The stages are ordered, least advanced first, and default to draft, sized,
validated, approved; the last is approval, and approval is commitment. An approval that
claims more than the records beneath it support fails the run, because that is the model
contradicting itself again: an epic further on than its least advanced product, an epic
approved before the quarter's budget and resourcing are, or an epic sized with nothing named.

Level 5 also enforces the register: every product is typed from the deliverable register,
the type is in use where the register has a `used` column, and an explicit `points` carries
a `points_override_reason`. Level 8 reads each epic's `lane` and `flows`. With a `ladder`
bound, an unknown rung or a movement down the ladder fails the run, and a missing lane or a
target rung no product evidences is a warning. Level 9 appears only once `rung_reached` or
`actual_points` has been recorded, and is read only.

Nothing is mastered here, and the capacity arithmetic is not implemented here either: it is
imported from src/capacity.py, which every tool that needs it shares. What it reads is named
by binding key, not by path, because where each one lives is the workspace's business and is
declared in [suite.quarter-planning] of its .agents/skill-bindings.toml:

  calendar     the period and its non-working time
  basis        the conversion parameters, and the declared quarter capacity and budget
  resourcing   people, allocation, leave, and the share of each going to each epic
  sources      work_item.yaml, for budget_points and the named products, and work_plan.yaml,
               for which epics the quarter committed to
  register     base points per product type, the `used` flag, and the rung each type evidences

None of those has a default. Optional keys opt in to more: `ladder` for the definition
ladder, `epicsDir` and `cardsDir` for the epic folders and the generated cards, and
`workItemsDir` to read epics from AAW work items' progress.yaml as well. Run with --where to see what this workspace resolves them to,
before reading any of them.

Run:  python <skills>/quarter-planning/bin/quarter.py --quarter <slug> [--apply]
      python <skills>/quarter-planning/bin/quarter.py --quarter <slug> --cards [--check]
      python <skills>/quarter-planning/bin/quarter.py --quarter <slug> --links [--check]

--links points every reference-link definition in the quarter folder's Markdown documents
whose label names an epic or a story, [EP-001]: or [EP-001-A2]:, at that record's own page:
the siteUrl binding plus the site_route the record carries in the model. See src/links.py.

--apply writes the derived budget_points onto each epic in work_item.yaml, replacing only
that one value on that one line, or inserting the line after the record's id where there is
none, after taking a .bak copy. Use it when the distribution has changed and the recorded
budgets are behind it.

--cards writes one card per committed epic and the stage grid to the cardsDir binding, and
with --check writes nothing and fails if any is stale. Everything else is read only.
